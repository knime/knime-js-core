 *  ECLIPSE with only the license terms in place for ECLIPSE applying to
 *  ECLIPSE and the GNU GPL Version 3 applying for KNIME, provided the

 *  propagation of ECLIPSE together with KNIME.
 *
 *  Additional permission relating to nodes for KNIME that extend the Node
 *  Extension (and in particular that are based on subclasses of NodeModel,
 *  NodeDialog, and NodeView) and that only interoperate with KNIME through

 *  Nodes are deemed to be separate and independent programs and to not be

 * The purpose of this interface is to solve UIEXT-1131 (no file-chooser opens when clicking a file-url in CEF).

 * a combination with the path of the file to download in order to build the download link which in turn then can be
 * intercepted and interpreted by the CEF middleware.
 *
 * If no url is set, the file download link will be a file-url (file://<absolute path>).
